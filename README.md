# Analogue Pocket Drive Icon Set
This set includes icons for your Analogue Pocket, allowing you to change the icon associated with the SD card in Windows or Mac OS.

## Windows Instructions
1. Download the [Icon Library](https://github.com/random11x/Analogue-Pocket-Drive-Icon-Set/blob/main/Analogue_Pocket_Ico_Lib.icl) which contains all the icons in one file. (Or download an individual ico file from the Windows Icons folder)
2. Download the [autorun.inf file](https://github.com/random11x/Analogue-Pocket-Drive-Icon-Set/blob/main/autorun.inf).
3. Edit the `autorun.inf` file and modify the second line to match your preferred icon color/design. For instance: `icon=Analogue_Pocket_Ico_Lib.icl,15` represents the Blue 3D icon. (If you downloaded an individual ico file just put the ico file name instead, for instance: `icon=Red.ico`)
4. Place both downloaded files in the root directory of your SD card.

Upon inserting the SD card into your computer, the drive icon should now display an image of the Analogue Pocket.

## Mac Instructions
1. Download an icon from the [Mac Icons folder](https://github.com/random11x/Analogue-Pocket-Drive-Icon-Set/tree/main/Mac%20Icons).
2. In finder, right click on the drive for your SD card and choose `Get Info` to open the properties dialog.
3. Drag the icon file onto the icon of the drive in the top left corner of the properties window, this will update the icon for your drive.

Alternatively you can put the `.icns` file in the root of your SD card and rename it to `.VolumeIcon.icns`. This should work however you may need to restart your computer to see the new icon. If you are having issues try the `Get Info` approach.
