# Analogue Pocket Drive Icon Set
This set includes icons for your Analogue Pocket SD card, allowing you to change the icon associated with the drive in Windows.

## Instructions
1. Download the [Icon Library](https://github.com/random11x/Analogue-Pocket-Drive-Icon-Set/blob/main/Analogue_Pocket_Ico_Lib.icl).
2. Download the [autorun.inf file](https://github.com/random11x/Analogue-Pocket-Drive-Icon-Set/blob/main/autorun.inf).
3. Edit the autorun.inf file and modify the second line to match your preferred icon color/design. For instance: `icon=Analogue_Pocket_Ico_Lib.icl,15` represents the Blue 3D icon.
4. Place both downloaded files in the root directory of your SD card.

Upon inserting the SD card into your computer, the drive icon should now display an image of the Analogue Pocket.
